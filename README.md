# Gamers

Our website is Gamers. It is a social media app designed by gamers for gamers. The goal was a web page where users could log in and make posts to threads about their favorite games.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a fullstack web application for MSU Coding Bootcamp. We were interested in taking on more of a challenge and a social media application seemed like something in our ballpark. The inspiration for our project were web pages like Reddit, and LinkedIn.

The members of our team all have an intrest in gaming and we wanted to include our intrest in the project we were working on. A revelent gaming social media app doesnt seem to exist, So we decided to try and fill that niche.*

Throughout this project we learned alot about the importance of quality database design, the implementation of handlebars, using npm packages, and troubleshooting.

This project is currently not deployed. Check back for updates!
